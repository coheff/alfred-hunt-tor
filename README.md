If running on macOS Catalina or later, you _**MUST**_ add Alfred to the list of security exceptions for running unsigned software. Step-by-step instructions are available on the awgo wiki [here](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo/wiki/Catalina).

# Usage
Trigger a search using the keyword `t` followed by a search query. \
Seach categories using `#movies`, `#music`, and `#tv` tags. \
Order results using `-s` (seeders) and `-t` (time) flags. Ordering is descending only, for now.
